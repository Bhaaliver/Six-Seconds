Six Seconds Submission
1.I want to make this project because when I was little and learning to play DnD turns during combat always took along time

2.You would need a basic understanding of DND fundamentals, if the server was running you would need no technical skills

3. To install you need to run this command git clone https://github.com/Bhaaliver/Six-Seconds-Front-End then cd into it by cd Six-Seconds-Front-End. Lastly you need to have Node JS install and then run this final command to run it in dev mode nom run dev

4. Since we didn’t finish the project here is the header
5. We have a reacted TS frontend and a Java backend using web socket although I think we should have used java spring boot to make a rest api because web sockets are designed to make real time apps like a online leader board
6. I would like to set up a Node rest API backend I am going to work on this over the summer so if you want you can follow progress at my GitHub https://github.com/Bhaaliver/Six-Seconds-Front-End I can’t find where the backend is
7. This is the documentation for react: https://react.dev this is a very popular front-end library that allows to to write HTML as a return for javascript functions

Here is typescript documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/ type script is a version of javascript that is type specific like java although you can have two or even more types of variable in a single variable instead of defining the type of variable it is mostly inferred by the computer and when you are done coding you can then compile back into javascript this makes it so I make less stupid errors

This is the documentation for tale wind(https://talewind.com) tale wind is a css style library that removes the tedious process of writing css
